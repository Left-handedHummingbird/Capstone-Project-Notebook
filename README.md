# Capstone project for the IBM Data Science Specialization: The old man gym locator in Toronto

This Capstone project aims to predict where should one open a gym for old people in Toronto. 
Knowing that the service would not be cheap and that people tend to go to gyms near their house the analysis was done.
The geoinformation was taken from the Foursquare services and the 2016 Canadian census web services (https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/wds-sdw/cpr2016-eng.cfm).
